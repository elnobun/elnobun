### Hi,

I'm a Front-End Web Developer who is passionate about using code to solve problems through peer collaboration, contribution to open source, and building community. I enjoy working with tools like Next.js and MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). I have specialized in helping entrepreneurs grow their businesses through bespoke web applications. On average, I have been able increase their customer retention by analytically identifying their business needs, stakeholders and recommending technological solutions.

### Some of my work:
